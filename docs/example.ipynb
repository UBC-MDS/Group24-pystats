    "Welcome to the `pystats` package documentation! This package offers a suite of functions to simulate, analyze and interpret data that follows a normal distribution curve. This package provides similar functionality to R's `rnorm`, `pnorm`, `dnorm` and `qnorm` functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate the usage of the 4 functions in our package `pystats` with a real-life example. Our example features a high school teacher named Mr. Gittu. Mr. Gittu would like to streamline the process of predicting and evaluating test scores, and our package can help him with this! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mr. Gittu's Motivation\n",
    "Mr. Gittu is an experienced computer science teacher at Hogwarts School of Data Science. He will be administering a standardized test and he knows that the test scores for the class he teaches usually follow a normal distribution with:\n",
    "- A class average of 70% \n",
    "- Standard deviation of 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "He wants to use the `pystats` package to streamline the process of predicting and evaluating test scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Simulating Test Scores Distribution with `rnorm`\n",
    "Before administering the test, Mr. Gittu would like to simulate 40 scores so he can understand what results to expect for his class in the next test. Using `rnorm`, Gittu generates a sample of 40 test scores with a mean of 70 and standard deviation of 10. "
