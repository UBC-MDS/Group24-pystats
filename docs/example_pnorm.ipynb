    "Mr. Gittu wants all of his students to pass. Unfortunately, there is always a risk of students failing his tests, even when he does his best job teaching. He wants to assess the risk of failure (i.e. score below 50%) given a randomly selected student with the same normal distribution defined above. Using `pnorm`, he can easily get the expected proportion of students getting less than 50% on his test."
